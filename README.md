Following the tutorial

It was a dark and stormy evening with the heavy drop of dusk sufforcating the day that was. In the deep shaddow of wind tortured branches of a large oak tree crouched a figure. On closer inspection, a trained eye would pick out the elfine facial features cloaked by, well, a cloak. The figure appeared to be watching. Watching and waiting. Suddenly the figure pounced forward. Unfortunately she tripped on a large tree root and stumbled in with increasing speed down a small decline, crashing into the still waters of a pond at the bottom. So much for the practice.
